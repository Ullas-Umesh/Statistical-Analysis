# Health Insurance Charges Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the factors influencing health insurance charges using statistical methods and data visualization techniques. The analysis employs a robust dataset encompassing various individual attributes, lifestyle choices, and regional information to uncover patterns and relationships that impact insurance costs.

## Dataset
The analysis is performed on a dataset containing information about individuals, including age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking habits, geographic region, and medical insurance charges.

## Analysis Techniques
The analysis employs various techniques, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, multiple linear regression, tests for differences (Mann-Whitney U test, t-test), and tests for central tendencies (Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA). Interactive visualizations are utilized to present the findings effectively.

## Results and Findings
The analysis revealed that age, BMI, smoking status, and geographic region have a significant impact on medical insurance charges. Factors like smoking and higher BMI were associated with increased insurance costs, while regional variations in BMI were observed. Detailed findings and conclusions are presented in the report.
